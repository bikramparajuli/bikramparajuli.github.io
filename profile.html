        <p>
            I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at the University of Oklahoma and a geomatics engineer by training. My work integrates spatial analysis, optimization, GeoAI, and machine learning to create advanced frameworks for facility location modelling and to address complex environmental, weather, and climate challenges.
