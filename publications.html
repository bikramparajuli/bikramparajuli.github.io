              Mobile weather radars have been routinely deployed to acquire high-quality meteorological data for research purposes, particularly for monitoring rapidly evolving weather phenomena at low altitudes. However, identifying an optimal location for mobile weather radar deployment is a complex challenge, as it requires consideration of operational safety, data quality, and environmental constraints. In this study, we introduce a framework using a coverage-based location problem to solve the strategic deployment of a single mobile weather radar. This approach aims to enhance weather observation while accounting for the deployment space’s safety constraints and geospatial characteristics. The proposed location problem is solved optimally using the geometric branch-and-bound algorithm and heuristically using swarm-based optimization algorithms. The implementation relies entirely on open-source Python packages, allowing the work to be verified, replicated, and expanded upon by the broader scientific community. Results demonstrate that exact solution methods are ideal when ample time is available for decision-making and optimal deployment locations are desired. In contrast, heuristic algorithms can efficiently identify multiple near-optimal deployment locations, making them highly suitable for rapid decision-making and evaluating alternative deployment options. Moreover, the findings highlight the potential of quantitative decision-making techniques in improving the effectiveness of mobile radar positioning, thereby contributing to efficient weather observation, forecasting, and better-informed emergency response strategies.

              Accurate radar observations are critical to improving the prediction and warning of severe weather events and supporting the mission of the National Weather Service in protecting lives and property. Mobile radars have been demonstrated to enhance the modeling of severe weather events by providing high-resolution observations. The deployment of mobile radar vehicles, therefore, becomes an essential research topic for improving the understanding and prediction of extreme weather phenomena. Even though many articles have been published on research using mobile radar observations, determining a mobile radar location is typically based on the intuition, experience, and judgment of knowledgeable practitioners. This proof-of-concept article provides the first quantitative approach using data-driven analysis and rigorous logic to determine the best possible location to deploy the mobile radar vehicle. Designed for field use, a framework consisting of digital information, geographic information systems (GIS), and spatial optimization was developed to delineate feasible areas, eliminate inferior solutions, and identify suitable locations. Findings and results highlight the potential utility and benefit of systematically analyzing mobile radar siting. This rational, transparent, and replicable decision-making process can significantly aid human meteorological observation.

              Satellite-based precipitation products can be a better alternative of rain gauges for hydro-meteorological studies in data-poor regions. This study aimed to evaluate how regional and seasonal precipitation and drought patterns had changed in the Ganga–Brahmaputra Basin between 1983 and 2020 with PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data. The spatial pattern of winter drought, monsoon drought, and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) calculated for different time scales were evaluated using principal component analysis. Ganga–Brahmaputra is one of the most populated river basins that flows through different geographical regions. Rain gauges are heterogeneously distributed in the basin due to its complex orography, highlighting the significance of gridded precipitation products over gauge observations for climate studies. Annual and monthly precipitation trends between 1983 and 2020 were evaluated using the original and modified Mann–Kendall trend test, and annual precipitation in the basin was found to be declining at a rate of 5.8 mm/year. An increasing trend was observed in pre-monsoon rainfall, whereas precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend for other months. Results of the Pettitt test showed precipitation time series was inhomogeneous and changepoint occurred around 2000. Decreasing trends of SPI indicated increasing frequency and intensity of drought events. Winter drought showed a clear spatial pattern in the basin; however, SPIs calculated for different time scales and monsoon drought had complex spatial patterns. This study demonstrates the applicability of satellite-based PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data in climate research in the Ganga–Brahmaputra Basin.
